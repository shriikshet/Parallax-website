# Parallax Scrolling Website

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Parallax Scrolling Website** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It implements scroll-based parallax effects where background and foreground elements move at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating a depth-driven and visually engaging user experience.

The project is built using **vanilla JavaScript**, without any external libraries or frameworks.
